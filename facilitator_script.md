# Facilitator Script (5–20 minutes)

## Opening (30 seconds)
“Welcome! Tonight we’re becoming Scam-Spotting Sleuths. You’ll see real-life messages and calls. Your job: decide what’s safe, what’s fishy, and what to do next. There are no perfect people—only good habits.”

## Ground Rules
- No shame. Scams are engineered to trick smart people.
- We go slow. We verify.

## Teaching Mantras (repeat often)
- **Pause → Verify → Delete/Report**
- **If it’s urgent + secret + payment = scam**
- **No one legitimate asks for gift cards**

## Flow
1. Read the scenario out loud.
2. Ask: “What’s the clue?” (odd sender, urgency, payment request, link).
3. Take votes. Click an answer. Read the feedback box.
4. Celebrate a catch. If missed, say: “Now you know the pattern!”

## Closing
“You just trained your scam radar. Share one tip with a friend tonight. That’s how a safer community grows.”
