# Answer Key (Quick Reference)

1) Grandparent Emergency Call → **Scam** (call back using a known family number)
2) Package Text with Link → **Scam** (go to carrier app/site directly)
3) “Medicare” asking for SSN via phone → **Scam** (Medicare won’t ask for SSN/payments to continue benefits)
4) Tech Support Pop-Up with a phone number → **Scam** (close browser; never call numbers in pop-ups)
5) Bank Text: “Click to unlock” → **Likely Scam** (call bank on card back; don’t tap link)
6) Romance Contact asks for gift cards → **Scam** (gift cards = untraceable payment)
7) Utility Bill Threatens Immediate Disconnection + Zelle → **Scam** (utilities don’t demand instant apps)
8) “IRS Refund – Pay small fee first” → **Scam** (IRS doesn’t ask fees via text/email)

Golden rule: urgent + payment + secrecy = almost certainly a scam.
